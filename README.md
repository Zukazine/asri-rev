# ASRI - All Sectors Recommendation Infrastructure

ASRI (All Sectors Recommendation Infrastructure) is a geospatially-driven framework designed to provide holistic infrastructure assessment, monitoring, and recommendations. This platform processes geospatial data interactively and responsively to support decision-making in various infrastructure sectors.

## Features

1. **Geospatial Data Analysis and Modeling (GEE)**
   - Utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyze and model spatial data.
   - Provides in-depth insights from processed geospatial data to inform policy and infrastructure decisions.
2. **Spatial Data Overlay Simulation Platform**

   - Interactive platform for simulating the overlay of multiple spatial datasets.
   - Supports scenario analysis for infrastructure planning and monitoring.

3. **Storymap**
   - Combines data visualization and storytelling to present spatial insights.
   - Interactive maps integrated with narrative content to engage users and explain complex spatial relationships.

## Sectors Involved

ASRI engages with the following sectors under the Ministry of Public Works and Housing (PUPR):

1. **Water Resources Sector (Sumber Daya Air)**
   - Assessment of water resource infrastructure, including dams, irrigation systems, and flood control measures.
2. **Public Works Sector (Bina Marga)**
   - Infrastructure planning and evaluation of road networks, bridges, and other public facilities.
3. **Housing Sector (Perumahan)**
   - Housing development projects, monitoring residential needs, and policy recommendations.
4. **Human Settlements Sector (Cipta Karya)**
   - Evaluation of public facilities, sanitation, and urban planning to improve the quality of life in human settlements.
