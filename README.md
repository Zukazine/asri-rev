# ASRI - All Sectors Recommendation Infrastructure

ASRI (All Sectors Recommendation Infrastructure) is a geospatially-driven framework designed to provide holistic infrastructure assessment, monitoring, and recommendations. This platform processes geospatial data interactively and responsively to support decision-making in various infrastructure sectors.

## Features

### 1. Geoplatform (Gio)

- A versatile platform for geospatial data visualization and storytelling.
- Includes a **Storymap** feature that combines interactive maps with narrative content, helping users explore and understand complex spatial relationships through engaging presentations.

### 2. Spatial Data Overlay Simulation (Ovy)

- An interactive tool for simulating the overlay of multiple spatial datasets.
- Enables scenario-based analysis to support infrastructure planning, monitoring, and decision-making.

### 3. Geotagging (Formy)

- A streamlined form-based system for collecting geospatial data with geotagging capabilities.
- Designed to support efficient data collection for infrastructure projects and field surveys.
